<h1>Welcome to Asad's P1</h1>
Hi, my name is Asad Saqib. Welcome to my CSCI E-15 Project 1 page. 
<br>
A very brief bio of myself: I live in the Washington, DC area and am in the process of completing my Masters. I work at a small software development startup and much of my focus has been on mobile development. I primarily act as a project manager and business analyst, but wear multiple hats at my job. Many times I get involved with software architecture and UI/UX as well. I did my undergrad at UVA. I'm very much looking forward to this course and have already within the first few weeks have learned a great deal. I'm quickly finding that my hesitation and worries towards web development is turning into curiosity and enjoyment. I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can and truly appreciate Prof Susan's step-by-step teaching style, and how helpful and patient Alain has been with assisting me understand all of the material thus far.

I initially was using notepad, but have recently switched to Sublime Text 2 as my code editor.
